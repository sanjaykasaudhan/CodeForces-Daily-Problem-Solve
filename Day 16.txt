🎯 Problem Overview: A strategic coalition-building problem requiring selection of parties to achieve majority with minimum partners.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Greedy selection with threshold checking

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Processing: Read count n and party seats array a 
2️⃣ Total Calculation: Compute total = sum(a) for all seats 
3️⃣ Majority Threshold: Calculate need = total // 2 + 1 (majority requirement) 
4️⃣ Result Initialization: Create res = [1] (always include party 1), s = a[0] 
5️⃣ Greedy Selection: Loop from i in range(1, n):
If a[0] >= 2*a[i]: Add party to coalition
Accumulate seats: s += a[i]
Check if s >= need: break early 
6️⃣ Output Logic:
If s < need: print 0 (impossible)
Else: print coalition size and party indices

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Greedy Strategy: Select parties where first party has dominant influence
Majority Calculation: total//2 + 1 ensures absolute majority
Conditional Selection: a[0] >= 2*a[i] ensures control
Early Termination: Break when majority achieved
Sequential Processing: Process parties in given order
O(n) Time Complexity: Single pass through parties

Test 1: 46ms, 0KB ⚡
Test 2: 46ms, 0KB
Consistent performance with zero memory! 🚀

🎓 Political Algorithm: This problem demonstrates greedy coalition formation with dominance constraints. The key insight: only form coalitions where you maintain control! 🏛️
