🚀 Codeforces Problem Solved – “Elevator or Stairs?” (AC ✅) 🏢🪜

Glad to share another Accepted solution on Codeforces 🎉
 This time, it’s Problem A – Elevator or Stairs? from
 Mail.Ru Cup 2018 Round 1 🏆

🧠 Problem Insight
Given:
Starting floor x
Destination floor y
Elevator starting floor z
Time to move 1 floor by stairs t1
Elevator moving time per floor t2
Elevator door open/close time t3
👉 The task is to decide whether using the elevator is faster than taking the stairs.

🔍 Solution Approach
We simply calculate total time for both options and compare:
🪜 Stair Time
Time required =
 |x − y| × t1

🏢 Elevator Time
Elevator first comes from z to x
Then goes from x to y
Includes door open & close time
Time required =
 |z − x| × t2 + |x − y| × t2 + 3 × t3
✅ Decision Logic
If Elevator Time ≤ Stair Time → print "YES"
Else → print "NO"

This direct comparison ensures:
⚡ Constant time complexity O(1)
🎯 Accurate decision-making
🧠 Clean and readable logic

💡 Key Learning
Sometimes, problem-solving is about modeling real-life scenarios mathematically rather than complex algorithms. Small problems like these sharpen logical thinking and speed 💪

📈 Staying consistent with Codeforces practice to strengthen fundamentals and competitive programming skills.
