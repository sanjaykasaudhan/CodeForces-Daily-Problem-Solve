🎯 Problem Overview: An elegant mathematical comparison problem requiring sum validation between two arrays.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Direct sum comparison with ternary operator

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Parsing: Read count n and two arrays x, y 
2️⃣ Array Processing: Convert inputs to lists with map(int, input().split()) 
3️⃣ Sum Comparison: Use ternary: "Yes" if sum(x) >= sum(y) else "No" 
4️⃣ Single-Line Output: Print result directly

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Built-in Sum: Python's sum() function for O(n) aggregation
Ternary Operator: Compact conditional with if-else expression
Comparison Logic: >= checks if first sum at least equals second
Direct Output: No intermediate variables needed
O(n) Time Complexity: Two linear sum operations
O(1) Extra Space: Only storing final boolean result
