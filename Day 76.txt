🧩 Problem Insight
The sequence alternates between x and −x.
 So the total sum depends only on whether n is odd or even:
n odd → one extra x remains → sum = x
n even → all pairs cancel out → sum = 0
A classic case where observing the pattern eliminates the need for simulation.

🎯 Key Takeaways
Pattern recognition > brute force
Simple parity checks can solve seemingly tricky problems
Div. 4 problems are great for building speed + confidence
