🎯 Problem Overview: A clever string manipulation problem requiring vowel reduction following specific linguistic rules.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Sequential filtering with conditional accumulation

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Processing: Read length n and string s 
2️⃣ Vowel Set: Define v = set('aeiouy') for O(1) lookup 
3️⃣ Result Initialization: res = '' for building output 
4️⃣ Character Iteration: Loop through each c in string s 
5️⃣ Conditional Logic:
If NOT (res exists OR NOT (c in v AND res[-1] in v)): append character
Translation: Add char if result empty OR current isn't vowel OR previous wasn't vowel 
6️⃣ String Accumulation: res += c builds result incrementally 
7️⃣ Output: Print corrected string

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Set Membership: O(1) vowel checking with 'aeiouy' set
Negative Indexing: res[-1] accesses last character safely
Boolean Logic: Complex condition with not, or, and operators
Sequential Processing: Single left-to-right pass
String Concatenation: Build result character by character
De Morgan's Laws: Apply logical negation strategically
O(n) Time Complexity: Linear scan through input

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 46ms, 20KB
Test 2: 0ms, 0KB (Perfect!)
Test 3: 15ms, 0KB
Excellent efficiency! 🚀

🎓 String Algorithm Elegance: This problem demonstrates sophisticated conditional logic for string filtering. The key insight: prevent consecutive vowels by checking both current and previous characters! 📝
