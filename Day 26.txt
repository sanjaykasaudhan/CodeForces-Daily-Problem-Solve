🎯 Problem Overview: A clever sequential analysis problem requiring tracking of time intervals and threshold detection with early termination.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Sequential scanning with gap detection and accumulation

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Processing: Read count n and timing array t 
2️⃣ Initialization: Set prev = 0, ans = 90 (default answer) 
3️⃣ Sequential Loop: For each x in array t: 
4️⃣ Gap Check: If x - prev > 15:
Update answer: ans = prev + 15
Break early 
5️⃣ State Update: Set prev = x for next iteration 
6️⃣ Fallback Logic: Else block handles final case: if 90 - prev > 15: ans = prev + 15 
7️⃣ Output Result: Print final answer

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Gap Detection: x - prev > 15 identifies significant intervals
Early Termination: Break as soon as threshold exceeded
State Tracking: prev maintains last processed timestamp
Boundary Handling: Final check against 90 for edge case
Greedy Approach: First violation determines answer
O(n) Time Complexity: Single pass through array

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 46ms, 12KB
Test 2: 31ms, 0KB ⚡
Efficient sequential processing! 🚀

🎓 Pattern Recognition: This problem demonstrates elegant gap detection in sequential data. By tracking intervals and breaking early, we find the optimal stopping point! ⏱️
