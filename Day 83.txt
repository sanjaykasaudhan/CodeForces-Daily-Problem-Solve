🧠 Key Idea
The task boils down to math + range checking:
Compute the minimum possible sum of choosing k distinct numbers
Compute the maximum possible sum
Check if the given value x lies within this range
This transforms a seemingly tricky problem into an O(1) decision using arithmetic series formulas.

💡 What I Learned
Turning constraints into tight mathematical bounds
Using formulas to eliminate brute force
Writing concise, efficient logic under contest pressure
Consistency compounds 🚀
