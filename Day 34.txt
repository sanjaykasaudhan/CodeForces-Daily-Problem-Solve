⌨️ Broken Keyboard - Pattern Validation Excellence! ⌨️

Just solved "Broken Keyboard" from 2022-2023 ICPC, NERC, Southern and Volga Russian Regional Contest (Online Mirror, ICPC Rules, Preferably Teams) - Happy New Year! ✅

🔗Problem Link: https://lnkd.in/ggpRQXkQ

🎯 Problem Overview: A sophisticated string analysis problem requiring detection of typing patterns with state machine logic and boundary checking.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Sequential scanning with press count tracking and validation

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Test Case Loop: Process t test cases 
2️⃣ Input Processing: Read length n and string s 
3️⃣ State Initialization: Set i=0, press=1, ok=True 
4️⃣ While Loop: Scan while i<n with press tracking 
5️⃣ Pair Detection: If press%2==1, increment i 
6️⃣ Validation Check: Test boundary and character matching 
7️⃣ State Updates: Adjust counters based on conditions 
8️⃣ Output Logic: Print "YES" or "NO" based on validation

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
State Machine: Track position and press count simultaneously
Modulo Logic: press%2==1 determines valid pairs
Boundary Check: i+1>=n prevents index errors
Character Comparison: s[i]!=s[i+1] validates pairing
Early Termination: Break on first invalid pattern
O(n) Time Complexity: Single pass through string

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 31ms, 0KB ⚡
Efficient pattern detection! 🚀

🎓 String Pattern Recognition: This problem demonstrates elegant state tracking in sequential validation. The combination of position tracking and press counting enables robust pattern detection! 🎯
