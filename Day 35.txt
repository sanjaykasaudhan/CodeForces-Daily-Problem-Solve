🎯 Problem Overview: A sophisticated geometric problem requiring optimal segment selection and area maximization through coordinate manipulation.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Sorting with min-max coordinate extraction

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Test Case Loop: Process t test cases 
2️⃣ Array Input: Read and sort 4 coordinates 
3️⃣ X-Axis Optimization:
x1 = min(a[0], a[1])
y1 = min(a[2], a[3]) 
4️⃣ Y-Axis Optimization:
x2 = min(a[0], a[2])
y2 = min(a[1], a[3]) 
5️⃣ Alternative Pairing:
x3 = min(a[0], a[3])
y3 = min(a[1], a[2]) 
6️⃣ Maximum Area: print(max(x1*y1, x2*y2, x3*y3))

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Sorting Strategy: Ordered coordinates simplify pairing
Three Configurations: Try all valid pairings
Min Function: Ensures non-negative dimensions
Area Calculation: Product of two dimensions
Max Selection: Choose optimal configuration
O(1) After Sort: Constant time operations post-sorting

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 46ms, 4KB
Test 2: 140ms, 0KB
Efficient geometric optimization! 🚀

🎓 Geometric Reasoning: This problem demonstrates exhaustive configuration testing! By trying all valid pairings and choosing maximum, we find optimal area. Beautiful combinatorial geometry! 📐
