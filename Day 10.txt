🎯 Problem Overview: A mathematical problem requiring distribution analysis based on modulo-3 arithmetic patterns.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Direct modular arithmetic classification

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Test Case Loop: Process t test cases 
2️⃣ Input Reading: Get value n 
3️⃣ Modulo Calculation: Compute r = n % 3 
4️⃣ Three-Way Classification:
If r == 0: print 0
Elif r == 1: print 2
Else: print 1

🧮 Key Mathematical Insights:
Modulo-3 Pattern: Three possible remainders (0, 1, 2)
Direct Mapping: Each remainder maps to specific output
Zero Remainder: Perfect division → output 0
Remainder 1: Requires 2 adjustments
Remainder 2: Requires 1 adjustment
O(1) Per Query: Constant time calculation
Pattern Recognition: Mathematical relationship between input and output

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 62ms, 0KB ⚡
Test 2: 31ms, 0KB
Blazing fast with zero memory! 🚀

🎓 Number Theory Elegance: This problem showcases the beauty of modular arithmetic! A complex distribution problem reduces to simple mod-3 classification with pattern-based output. 🔢
