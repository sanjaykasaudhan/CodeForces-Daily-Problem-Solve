🎯 Problem Overview: A classic hash table collision detection problem requiring set-based tracking and modulo operations.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Hash collision detection with set membership testing

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Parsing: Read p, n with map(int, input().split()) 
2️⃣ Set Initialization: Create empty set used = set() 
3️⃣ Iteration Loop: Process n+1 numbers 
4️⃣ Hash Calculation: Compute h = x % p (modulo operation) 
5️⃣ Collision Check: If h in used:
Print position i (1-indexed)
Break immediately 
6️⃣ Set Update: Add h to used set: used.add(h) 
7️⃣ No Collision: Else block prints -1

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Modulo Operation: x % p computes hash bucket
Set Membership: O(1) average collision detection
Early Termination: Break on first collision
1-Indexed Output: Report position starting from 1
Space Efficiency: Set stores only hash values, not original numbers
O(n) Time Complexity: Single pass with constant-time operations

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 15ms, 0KB ⚡
Test 2: 46ms, 0KB
Ultra-fast collision detection! 🚀

🎓 Hash Table Fundamentals: This problem demonstrates core hash table concepts—collision detection through bucket tracking. Understanding modulo arithmetic and set operations is key! 🔑
