🎯 Problem Overview: An elegant matrix problem requiring identification and summation of elements on diagonals and boundaries.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Position-based conditional accumulation

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Processing: Read dimension n and matrix rows with list comprehension 
2️⃣ Midpoint Calculation: Compute m = n // 2 for center reference 
3️⃣ Sum Initialization: Set s = 0 for accumulator 
4️⃣ Double Loop: Nested iteration through rows and columns 
5️⃣ Condition Check: Multiple OR conditions:
i == j (main diagonal)
i + j == n-1 (anti-diagonal)
i == m (middle row)
j == m (middle column) 
6️⃣ Conditional Sum: Add a[i][j] when condition true 
7️⃣ Result Output: Print total sum

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Diagonal Detection: i == j for main, i+j == n-1 for anti-diagonal
Center Line Logic: Middle row/column at index n//2
OR Combination: Elements can satisfy multiple conditions
No Double Counting: Each element counted once (OR not AND)
O(n²) Complexity: Complete matrix scan required
List Comprehension: Clean input parsing

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 124ms, 0KB
Test 2: 62ms, 0KB ⚡
Efficient matrix processing! 🚀

🎓 Matrix Pattern Recognition: This problem demonstrates elegant coordinate-based pattern matching. The key insight: combine diagonal and cross patterns using logical OR! 📐
