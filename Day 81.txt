🧠 Problem Idea
Given a number n, check whether it can be represented as a sum of 2020 and 2021 any number of times.

💡 Key Observation
If n % 2020 ≤ n // 2020, then the number can be formed
Otherwise, it’s not possible
This simple mathematical insight avoids brute force completely.
✅ What I Practiced
Mathematical reasoning in competitive problems
Writing clean and minimal logic
Identifying patterns instead of overcomplicating
Another step forward in my consistent Codeforces & DSA practice 💪
