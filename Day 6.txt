🎯 Problem Overview: A clever game theory problem requiring simulation of alternating moves with parity-based winning condition.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Turn-based simulation with accumulation tracking

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Parsing: Read values a, b with map(int, input().split()) 
2️⃣ Variable Initialization:
turn = 1 (starting player)
odd = 0 (odd moves counter)
even = 0 (even moves counter) 
3️⃣ Simulation Loop: while True with turn alternation 
4️⃣ Turn 1 Logic:
Increment odd += turn
Check if odd > a: print "Vladik" and break 
5️⃣ Turn 2 Logic:
Increment even += turn
Check if even > b: print "Valera" and break 
6️⃣ Turn Increment: turn += 1 for next round

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Alternating Turns: Use modulo 2 logic with turn%2==1
Accumulation Pattern: Each player's sum grows by turn number
Win Condition: First player to exceed their limit loses
State Tracking: Separate counters for odd/even turns
Infinite Loop: Continue until break condition met
Early Termination: Exit immediately when threshold exceeded

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 31ms, 0KB ⚡
Test 2: 31ms, 0KB
Perfect consistency with zero memory! 🚀

🎓 Game Theory Application: This problem demonstrates elegant turn-based simulation. Tracking accumulations separately and checking thresholds captures the complete game state! 🎮
