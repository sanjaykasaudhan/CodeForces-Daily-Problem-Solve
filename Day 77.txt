🧠 Core Idea
The goal is to reach 1 using minimum operations:
multiply by 2
divide by 6 (only if divisible)
Instead of simulating operations, I analyzed the prime factors of n.
Count how many times n is divisible by 2 → cnt2
Count how many times n is divisible by 3 → cnt3

✅ Conditions
If after removing all 2s and 3s, n ≠ 1 → Impossible
If cnt2 > cnt3 → Impossible
Else → Minimum moves = (cnt3 − cnt2) + cnt3
This converts the problem into a pure math + counting solution.

🎯 Takeaways
Prime factorization simplifies many number problems
Greedy simulation is not always needed
Div. 3 problems sharpen mathematical thinking
Consistent practice, one problem at a time 🚀
