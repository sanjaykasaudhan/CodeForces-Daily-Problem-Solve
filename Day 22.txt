🎯 Problem Overview: A clever string analysis problem requiring counting directional moves with specific pattern constraints.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Sequential character tracking with conditional increment logic

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Processing: Read length n and direction string s 
2️⃣ Counter Initialization: Set l = 0 (left counter), i = 0 (index pointer) 
3️⃣ While Loop: Continue while i < n 
4️⃣ Diagonal Detection: Check if i+1 < n and s[i] != s[i+1]:
Increment both counters: l += 1, i += 2 (skip pair) 
5️⃣ Single Direction: Else case handles non-diagonal moves:
l += 1, i += 1 (process single character) 
6️⃣ Result Output: Print total moves

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Lookahead Pattern: Check s[i] != s[i+1] for diagonal detection
Pair Processing: Diagonal moves consume two characters
Index Manipulation: Variable increment (i+=1 vs i+=2)
Boundary Check: i+1 < n prevents index out of bounds
Sequential Processing: Single-pass left-to-right scan
O(n) Time Complexity: Linear traversal with early breaks

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 31ms, 8KB
Test 2: 31ms, 20KB
Efficient string processing! 🚀

🎓 Direction Encoding: This problem demonstrates clever pattern recognition in directional sequences. By detecting adjacent different characters, we identify diagonal moves efficiently! 🧭
