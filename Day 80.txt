🟢 Codeforces Accepted | Balanced Round (Problem D)

Happy to share that I solved Problem D – Balanced Round in Codeforces Round 886 (Div. 4) ✅
 Language: Python 🐍

🧠 Problem Insight
The task was to determine the minimum number of elements to remove so that the remaining array becomes balanced, meaning the difference between consecutive elements is at most k.

💡 My Approach
Sort the array first
Traverse and track the longest valid contiguous segment where
 a[i] - a[i-1] ≤ k
Final answer =
 Total elements − Length of longest valid segment
This converts the problem into a sliding window / greedy traversal after sorting.

✅ Key Learnings
Sorting often simplifies constraint-based problems
Tracking longest valid segments is more efficient than brute force
Div-4 D problems really test clarity of logic, not complexity
One more step forward in my daily DSA & Competitive Programming journey 🚀
