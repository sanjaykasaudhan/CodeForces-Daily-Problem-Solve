🧠 Problem Insight
We are given an n × n matrix and need to calculate the sum of “good” elements.
👉 An element is considered good if it lies on:
Main diagonal
Secondary diagonal
Middle row
Middle column
(Only valid for odd n)

💡 Approach
Read the matrix input
Compute mid = n // 2
Traverse each cell (i, j)
Add a[i][j] if any one of the following holds:
i == j (main diagonal)
i + j == n - 1 (secondary diagonal)
i == mid (middle row)
j == mid (middle column)
✔️ This ensures each valid element is counted once

⚙️ Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n²)
Space Complexity: O(1) (excluding input storage)

📌 Key Takeaway
This problem strengthens:
Matrix traversal logic
Index-based condition checking
Clean implementation using basic control structures
Consistency is the key 🔥
