🎨 ASCII Art Contest - Sorting Logic Mastery! 🎨

Just solved "ASCII Art Contest" from 2025 ICPC Asia Taichung Regional Contest (Unrated, Online Mirror, ICPC Rules, Preferably Teams) - Accepted! ✅

🔗Problem Link: https://lnkd.in/gP5h4ybK

🎯 Problem Overview: An intriguing sorting validation problem requiring analysis of ASCII value ordering to determine final outcomes.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Sort and compare with index-based threshold checking

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Parsing: Read g, c, l with map(int, input().split()) 
2️⃣ Array Creation: Convert to list and sort: a = sorted([g, c, l]) 
3️⃣ Threshold Check: If a[2] - a[0] >= 10:
Print "check again" 
4️⃣ Winner Determination: Else, print "final" with winner index: a[1]

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Sorting Strategy: Use sorted() for ascending order
Range Calculation: a[2] - a[0] gives max spread
Threshold Logic: >= 10 determines if range too wide
Middle Element: a[1] is median after sorting
Index-Based Access: Direct array indexing for efficiency
O(1) Sorting: Only 3 elements to sort

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 15ms, 0KB ⚡
Test 2: 31ms, 0KB
Test 3: 31ms, 0KB
Ultra-fast with zero memory! 🚀

🎓 Decision Logic: This problem showcases elegant threshold-based decision making. By sorting first, we simplify the range check and winner determination! 🏆
