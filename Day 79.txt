🧠 Problem Summary
Given a bank account balance (which can be negative), the goal is to maximize the final value by optionally removing one digit from the number (except the minus sign).

💡 Approach
If the number is positive, print it directly
If the number is negative, compare:
The original number
Number after removing the last digit
Number after removing the second last digit
Print the maximum possible value
This works because only two valid digit-removal choices exist for a negative number.

✅ Key Takeaways
Edge cases matter more than complex logic
String manipulation can simplify numeric problems
Always check all valid transformations
Consistency over motivation—one more problem done 🚀
