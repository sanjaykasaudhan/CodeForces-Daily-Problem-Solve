🎉 Happy New Year with a Coding Win! 🎊

Just solved the "Chores" problem from Educational Codeforces Round 30 - a great way to kick off 2025! ✅

🧩 The Challenge: Given a list of numbers, find a subset that sums to exactly x by strategically removing elements.

💡 My Approach:
Sort in Reverse 📊 - Arranged all elements in descending order
Greedy Selection 🎯 - Iterated through the sorted array
Smart Filtering 🔍 - Kept only elements where a[i] > x
Sum It Up ➕ - Calculated the sum of remaining elements
Why This Works: By sorting in reverse and keeping elements greater than x, we automatically exclude the problematic elements. The remaining sum gives us our answer!

✨ Results: 
✅ All test cases passed 
⚡ Execution time: 31-46 ms 💾 Memory efficient: 0-32 KB
The beauty of competitive programming - sometimes the simplest greedy approach is the most elegant! 💪
