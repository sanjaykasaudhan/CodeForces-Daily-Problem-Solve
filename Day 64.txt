🚋 Codeforces Accepted | Determine Line

Happy to share another Accepted solution on Codeforces ✅

Contest: Mail.Ru Cup 2018 – Round 3
 Problem: A – Determine Line
 Verdict: Accepted
 Language: Python 🐍

🔗Problem Link: https://lnkd.in/g9u6K2yH

🧠 Key Learnings
Used set intersection to efficiently track common tram lines
Learned how simplifying data structures can drastically reduce logic complexity
Reinforced the idea that smart use of sets > brute force loops
This was a nice example of how choosing the right data structure makes the solution both elegant and efficient.

🚀 Moving Forward
Consistency is the real superpower in competitive programming.
 One problem at a time, one acceptance at a time 💪
