📚 Book Reading - Interval Intersection Mastery! 📚

Just solved "Book Reading" from Educational Codeforces Round 31 - Accepted! ✅

🔗Problem Link: https://lnkd.in/ggHKnU98

🎯 Problem Overview: An elegant number theory problem requiring efficient calculation of page reading patterns with large numbers.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Maximum-based calculation with threshold optimization

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Parsing: Read n, t and array a with map(int, input().split()) 
2️⃣ Iteration Loop: For each i in range(n): 
3️⃣ Maximum Calculation: t = max(0, 86400 - a[i]) 
4️⃣ Threshold Check: If t <= 0:
Print i + 1 (1-indexed result)
Break immediately 
5️⃣ Early Termination: Stop as soon as condition met

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Constant Threshold: 86400 represents daily limit (seconds in a day)
Max Function: max(0, ...) ensures non-negative values
Greedy Approach: Process elements sequentially until condition met
1-Indexed Output: Add 1 to convert from 0-indexed to 1-indexed
Early Exit: Break on first violation for efficiency
O(n) Worst Case: Linear scan through array

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 15ms, 4KB ⚡
Test 2: 31ms, 0KB
Test 3: 46ms, 0KB
Excellent efficiency! 🚀

🎓 Threshold Detection: This problem showcases sequential threshold checking with early termination. The key insight: find the first position where accumulated time exceeds the daily limit! ⏰
