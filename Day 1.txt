🎯 Problem Overview: A sophisticated number theory problem requiring optimal grouping strategy based on divisibility relationships.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Greedy selection with divisibility marking

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Processing: Read count n and sort array a 
2️⃣ Tracking Array: Initialize used = [False]*n for marking 
3️⃣ Counter Initialization: Set ans = 0 for groups 
4️⃣ Outer Loop: Iterate through each number 
5️⃣ Skip Used: If used[i], continue to next 
6️⃣ New Group: Increment ans, extract x = a[i] 
7️⃣ Inner Loop: Mark all multiples of x as used 
8️⃣ Divisibility Check: if not used[j] and a[j] % x == 0 
9️⃣ Result Output: Print minimum groups needed

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Sorting Advantage: Process smallest numbers first for optimal grouping
Greedy Strategy: Start each group with smallest unused number
Divisibility Marking: Mark all multiples of current number
Boolean Tracking: used array prevents reprocessing
Nested Loop Optimization: Skip already-used numbers
O(n²) Worst Case: Each number potentially checks all others
Mathematical Property: Smallest element captures most multiples

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 62ms, 0KB ⚡
Test 2: 62ms, 0KB
Consistent performance with zero memory! 🚀

🎓 Number Theory Meets Greedy: This problem beautifully combines divisibility properties with greedy optimization. By processing sorted numbers and marking multiples, we find the minimum grouping! 🔢
