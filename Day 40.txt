🎅 Santa Claus and Classroom Seating - A Fun New Year Coding Challenge! 🎄

Just solved an interesting problem from Technocup 2017 - Elimination Round 3 on CodeForces!

🎯 The Problem: Arrange students in a classroom with n rows, m columns, where some seats are already occupied. Determine if Santa (remainder student) sits on the Left or Right side of the desk!

💭 My Approach:
1️⃣ Calculate Layout 📐
Total lanes: (k-1) ÷ (2*m) + 1
Remainder students: (k-1) % (2*m)
Desk position: rem ÷ 2 + 1
2️⃣ Determine Side 🪑
Used modulo arithmetic to check if rem % 2 == 0
If zero → 'L' (Left side)
If non-zero → 'R' (Right side)
3️⃣ Output Results ✅Lane number, Desk number, and Side

🔑 Key Insight: The trick was understanding the seating pattern - desks fill left-to-right, and using integer division with modulo operations elegantly maps any student position to their exact seat! 🧮

⚡ Performance: 
✅ All test cases passed 
🚀 Ultra-fast: 15-31 ms execution 
💾 Memory efficient: 0-4 KB

Sometimes the most elegant solutions come from understanding the pattern rather than brute force! 💡
