🎯 Problem Overview: An elegant counting problem requiring analysis of positive and negative counts to determine the existence of a value satisfying specific conditions.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Conditional counting with threshold validation

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Parsing: Read count n and array a 
2️⃣ Threshold Calculation: need = (n+1) // 2 (ceiling division) 
3️⃣ Positive Count: pos = sum(1 for x in a if x > 0) 
4️⃣ Negative Count: neg = sum(1 for x in a if x < 0) 
5️⃣ Validation Logic:
If pos >= need: print 1
Elif neg >= need: print -1
Else: print 0

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Generator Expressions: Memory-efficient counting with sum(1 for ... if ...)
Ceiling Division: (n+1)//2 computes majority threshold
Three-Way Classification: Positive, negative, or inconclusive
Conditional Filtering: Count elements based on comparison operators
O(n) Time Complexity: Two linear passes through array
Mathematical Threshold: Majority requires > half of elements
