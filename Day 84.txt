🧠 Core Approach
Precompute a prefix sum array for fast range queries
For each query, simulate replacing a subarray with value k
Recalculate the total sum without modifying the array
Check if the new sum is odd or even
This reduces each query to O(1) time after preprocessing — efficient and clean ⚡

🚀 Key Takeaways
Prefix sums are extremely powerful for range-based problems
Avoid unnecessary updates when queries are independent
Think in terms of mathematical transformation, not simulation
Step by step, consistency pays off 📈
 Onward to the next challenge!
