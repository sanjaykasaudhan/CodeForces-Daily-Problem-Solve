☕ Sereja and Mugs - Greedy Sum Optimization! ☕

Just solved "Sereja and Mugs" from Codeforces Round 243 (Div. 2) - Happy New Year! ✅

🔗Problem Link: https://lnkd.in/gHN-h4mc

🎯 Problem Overview: An elegant optimization problem requiring decision-making based on sum comparison and capacity constraints.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Sum-to-max comparison with ternary operator

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Parsing: Read n, s and array a 
2️⃣ Sum Calculation: Compute sum(a) for total 
3️⃣ Maximum Detection: Find max(a) for largest element 
4️⃣ Comparison Logic: print("YES" if sum(a) - max(a) <= s else "NO")

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Greedy Strategy: Remove maximum and check remaining sum
Capacity Test: Compare sum - max against threshold s
Ternary Operator: Compact if-else using conditional expression
Built-in Functions: Leverage sum() and max() for efficiency
O(n) Time Complexity: Two linear scans (sum and max)
Single-Line Output: Direct boolean to string conversion

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 46ms, 0KB ⚡
Test 2: 15ms, 0KB
Test 3: 46ms, 0KB
Ultra-fast with zero memory! 🚀

🎓 Optimization Insight: This problem demonstrates greedy thinking—by removing the largest element, we maximize our chances of fitting the rest! Beautiful mathematical reasoning. 🎯
