Contest: ICPC 2023–2024 NERC (Online Mirror)
 Problem: L – LOL Lovers
 Verdict: Accepted ✅
 Language: Python

🧠 Problem Idea
Given a string consisting of ‘L’ and ‘O’, we need to find the earliest split point such that:
Number of L in prefix ≠ number of L in suffix
Number of O in prefix ≠ number of O in suffix
If no such split exists, return -1.

💡 Approach
Count total L and O
Traverse the string while maintaining prefix counts
Derive suffix counts using totals
Stop at the first valid split
✔️ One-pass logic
 ✔️ Efficient prefix–suffix counting

⚙️ Complexity
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
📌 Takeaway
ICPC problems often test logical clarity over heavy implementation.
 This one was a great exercise in prefix–suffix reasoning 🔍

Staying consistent with daily problem-solving 💪
