 (based on Forethought Future Cup – Final Round) 🏆

🧠 Problem Understanding
We are given:
n zones with an initial height limit h
m restrictions of the form (l, r, x)
Meaning: zones from l to r must have height ≤ x

🎯 Goal:
 Apply all restrictions and compute the sum of squares of the final height limits.

🔍 Approach & Logic
The solution uses a greedy and direct simulation:
Initialize an array limits of size n with all values set to h
For each restriction (l, r, x):
Iterate from l-1 to r-1
Update:
 limits[i] = min(limits[i], x)
After applying all constraints:
Compute the answer as
∑limits[i]2\sum limits[i]^2∑limits[i]2
This works because:
Each restriction only tightens the height limit
Applying the minimum constraint greedily ensures correctness

⚙️ Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n × m)
Space Complexity: O(n)
(Constraints are small enough for direct iteration to pass efficiently)

💡 Key Takeaway
This problem reinforces:
How range constraints can be handled with simple loops
The importance of reading constraints carefully
Sometimes the simplest approach is the best ✨
