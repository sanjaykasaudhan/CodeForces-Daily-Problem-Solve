✨ Finding Beauty in Numbers - A Simple Yet Elegant Solution! 🎯

Just cracked the "Beautiful Average" problem from Codeforces Round 1059 (Div. 3) - proof that sometimes the simplest approach is the most beautiful!

🎨 The Challenge: Given multiple arrays of numbers, find the maximum value from each array - a test of clean code and efficient thinking!

💡 My Approach:
Simple & Elegant 🌟
1️⃣ Read number of test cases (t)
2️⃣ For each test case:
 - Read array size (n)
 - Read the array elements
 - Print the maximum value

🔑 Key Insight: Sometimes competitive programming isn't about complex algorithms - it's about recognizing patterns and implementing clean, efficient solutions. Using Python's built-in max() function made this a breeze! 🍃
Why I Love This Problem:
Tests fundamental understanding ✅
Emphasizes code clarity 📝
Proves that optimization matters 🚀

⚡ Performance Metrics: 
✅ All test cases passed 
🏃 Lightning fast: 15-93 ms 
💾 Memory efficient: 0-36 KB 
🎯 Clean, readable code

The "Beautiful Average" in coding is finding the sweet spot between simplicity and efficiency! 💯
