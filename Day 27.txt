🎯 Problem Overview: An elegant mathematical problem requiring position calculation in a wave pattern with formula optimization.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Direct mathematical formula with min function

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Parsing: Read three values with map(int, input().split()) 
2️⃣ Variable Assignment: Destructure into n, k, t 
3️⃣ Formula Application: print(min(min(t, k), n + k - t)) 
4️⃣ Single-Line Solution: Compute result with nested min functions

🧮 Key Mathematical Insights:
Three-Way Comparison: Need minimum of three expressions
Rising Phase: t represents time/position
Peak Constraint: k is the maximum height
Falling Phase: n + k - t represents descent calculation
Nested Min: min(min(a, b), c) finds three-way minimum
O(1) Complexity: Constant time calculation!

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 15ms, 0KB ⚡
Test 2: 62ms, 0KB
Test 3: 31ms, 0KB
Ultra-fast with zero memory! 🚀

🎓 Mathematical Elegance: This problem showcases beautiful formula derivation! Understanding the wave pattern's rise-peak-fall structure leads to a single elegant expression. 📐
