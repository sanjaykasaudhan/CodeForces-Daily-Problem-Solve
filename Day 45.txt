🎉 Accepted on Codeforces – “Slime Combining” (AC ✅)

Happy to share another successful submission on Codeforces 🚀
 Solved Problem A – Slime Combining from
 Wunder Fund Round 2016 (Div. 1 + Div. 2 combined) 🏆

🧠 Problem Intuition
Slimes behave in a way similar to binary carry operations:
Each new slime starts with value 1
If the top of the stack has the same value, they combine
The combined slime increases its value by 1
This process continues until no two adjacent slimes are equal

🔍 Solution Approach
We use a stack to efficiently simulate the combining process:
Steps:
Initialize an empty stack
For each slime:
Start with value v = 1
While the stack is not empty and the top equals v:
Pop the top
Increment v
Push the updated value back into the stack
Print the final stack configuration

⚙️ Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(n) (each slime is pushed and popped at most once)
Space Complexity: O(n) for the stack

💡 Key Learning
This problem highlights how:
Stacks are powerful for handling repeated merging scenarios
Many problems can be mapped to binary-like merging logic
Simple data structures can solve problems efficiently ✨

📈 Staying consistent with Codeforces to sharpen my algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.
