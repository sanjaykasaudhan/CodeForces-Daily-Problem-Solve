🎯 Problem Overview: A classic buy-low-sell-high problem requiring optimal trading strategy to maximize returns on stock transactions.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Greedy selection with min/max tracking

📝 Solution Breakdown: 1️⃣ Input Parsing: Read n, m, r and buy prices s, sell prices b 
2️⃣ Minimum Buy Price: Find buy = min(s) (cheapest purchase option) 
3️⃣ Maximum Sell Price: Find sell = max(b) (best selling opportunity) 
4️⃣ Profitability Check: If sell <= buy, no profitable trade exists → print(r) 
5️⃣ Optimal Strategy:
Calculate max shares: shares = r // buy
Compute remainder: rem = r % buy
Final amount: rem + shares * sell 
6️⃣ Result Output: Print maximum achievable money

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Greedy Selection: Always buy at minimum and sell at maximum
Division for Shares: Integer division // determines affordable shares
Modulo for Remainder: % captures leftover money
Profitability Gate: Early exit if no profit possible
Mathematical Formula: remainder + shares × sell_price
O(n + m) Complexity: Linear scan to find min/max
