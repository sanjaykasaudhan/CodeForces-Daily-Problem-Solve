🎯 Problem Overview: A sophisticated 2D grid problem requiring detection of bounding box coordinates for special characters in a character grid.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Boundary tracking with min/max coordinate detection

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Parsing: Read dimensions n, m and grid with list comprehension 
2️⃣ Initialization:
min_r = n, max_r = 0 (row boundaries)
min_c = m, max_c = 0 (column boundaries) 
3️⃣ Grid Scanning: Double nested loop through rows and columns 
4️⃣ Character Detection: If grid[i][j] == '*', update boundaries:
min_r = min(min_r, i), max_r = max(max_r, i)
min_c = min(min_c, j), max_c = max(max_c, j) 
5️⃣ Output Generation: Print subgrid grid[i][min_c:max_c + 1] for rows in range 
6️⃣ Slice Extraction: Use Python slicing for efficient column extraction

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Bounding Box Algorithm: Track min/max coordinates of target characters
Min/Max Tracking: Continuously update boundaries during scan
Double Loop Pattern: Nested iteration for 2D grid traversal
List Comprehension: Clean input parsing with [input() for _ in range(n)]
String Slicing: [min_c:max_c + 1] extracts column range
O(n×m) Complexity: Complete grid scan required
