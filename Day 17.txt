🎯 Problem Overview: A strategic voting problem requiring calculation of minimum additional votes needed to achieve victory.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Iterative majority simulation with exponential growth

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Processing: Read count n and votes array a 
2️⃣ Sum Calculation: Compute s = sum(a) for total votes 
3️⃣ Maximum Detection: Find mx = max(a) (current leader) 
4️⃣ Counter Initialization: Set k = mx (starting candidate votes) 
5️⃣ While Loop: Continue while n*k <= 2*s:
Increment counter: k += 1 
6️⃣ Result Output: Print minimum votes needed

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Majority Condition: Need more than half of total votes: n*k > 2*s
Starting Point: Begin from current maximum to minimize iterations
Linear Increment: Simple k += 1 ensures finding minimum
Mathematical Inequality: Rearrange to avoid division: n*k <= 2*s
Early Termination: Stop as soon as condition violated
O(mx - answer) Complexity: Worst case iterates from max to solution
