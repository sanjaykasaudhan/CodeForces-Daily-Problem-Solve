🎯 Problem Overview: An elegant mathematical problem requiring calculation of optimal resource distribution using division operations.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Direct mathematical formula with integer division

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Parsing: Read four values with map(int, input().split()) 
2️⃣ Variable Assignment: Destructure into d, L, v1, v2 
3️⃣ Formula Application: print((L - d) / (v1 + v2)) 
4️⃣ Single-Line Solution: Compute result directly without intermediate variables

🧮 Key Mathematical Insights:
Distance Calculation: L - d represents remaining distance
Relative Velocity: v1 + v2 represents combined approach speed
Time Formula: Distance divided by relative velocity gives time
Float Division: Use / for decimal precision
Direct Output: No need for additional processing
O(1) Complexity: Constant time calculation!
