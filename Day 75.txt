🧠 Core Idea
The game outcome depends on a simple parity observation:
Players remove one stick alternately
The player who cannot make a move loses
The result depends on min(n, m) being odd or even
👉 If min(n, m) is odd → Akshat wins
 👉 If min(n, m) is even → Malvika wins
A perfect example of how game theory + math intuition simplifies the solution.

🚀 Takeaway
Many “game” problems boil down to parity checks
Thinking in terms of invariants saves time
Competitive programming sharpens logical reasoning
Consistency > complexity 💪
