🧠 Problem Insight
Given an integer n, represent it as a rectangle with sides a × b = n.
 The goal is to minimize the perimeter of the rectangle:
Perimeter=2(a+b)\text{Perimeter} = 2(a + b)Perimeter=2(a+b)

💡 Approach
Iterate through all divisors i ≤ √n
For each valid factor pair (i, n/i)
Compute the perimeter and keep the minimum
✔️ Efficient divisor traversal
 ✔️ Mathematical optimization
 ✔️ Clean brute-force within constraints

⚙️ Complexity
Time: O(√n)
Space: O(1)

📌 Takeaway
Sometimes the simplest-looking problems hide a neat math + optimization trick.

 ICPC-style questions really strengthen fundamental reasoning 🧩
Staying consistent with daily practice 💪
