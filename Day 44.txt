🔬 Okabe and Future Gadget Laboratory - A Matrix Pattern Challenge! 🧪

Just solved an intriguing problem from Codeforces Round 420 (Div. 2) that tests pattern recognition and nested loop mastery!

🎯 The Problem: Given an n×n matrix, determine if every element can be expressed as the sum of two or more other elements from its row and column. A true test of computational thinking! 🧮

💡 My Solution Strategy:
1️⃣ Matrix Input & Initialization 📊
python
n = int(input())
a = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
2️⃣ Triple Nested Loop Validation 🔄
Outer loop: iterate through rows (i)
Middle loop: iterate through columns (j)
Check if a[i][j] == 1 → special case!
3️⃣ Pattern Matching Logic 🎯
python
for s in range(n):
 if s != j:
 for t in range(n):
 if t != i and a[i][s] + a[t][j] == a[i][j]:
 ok = True
 break
4️⃣ Early Exit Optimization ⚡
Use break statements to exit early when pattern found
If no valid pattern exists → print "No" and exit
All elements valid → print "Yes"

🔑 Key Insights:
Element value of 1 is impossible to form (can't be sum of positives)
For each cell, we check ALL possible row+column combinations
The nested loop structure efficiently explores the solution space
Early termination saves computation time! 🚀

⚡ Performance: 
✅ All test cases passed 
🏃 Execution: 31 ms 
💾 Memory: 4-24 KB 
🎯 Optimized with break statements

This problem beautifully demonstrates how algorithmic thinking translates to real-world pattern validation scenarios! 💼
