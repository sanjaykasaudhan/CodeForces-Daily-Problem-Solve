🧠 Problem Summary
Given an n × n matrix, we compare:
Row sums
Column sums

🎯 Task:
 Count how many pairs (i, j) satisfy:
column_sum[j] > row_sum[i]

💡 Approach
Read the matrix
Precompute:
row[i] → sum of each row
col[j] → sum of each column
Use two nested loops to compare all (row, column) pairs
Increment count whenever col[j] > row[i]
✔️ Straightforward logic with clean implementation

⚙️ Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n²)
Space Complexity: O(n)

📌 Key Learning
Precomputing values avoids redundant calculations
Matrix problems often reduce to row vs column analysis
Simple brute force works well when constraints are small

Consistent practice is paying off 💪
