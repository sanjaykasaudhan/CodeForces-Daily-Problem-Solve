💻 System Administrator: LIVE or DEAD? 🖥️

Just solved an interesting problem from CROC-MBTU 2012, Elimination Round (ACM-ICPC) - a creative take on system monitoring!

🎯 The Problem: Monitor multiple servers and determine if they're "LIVE" or "DEAD" based on activity thresholds within a specific time window.

💡 My Solution Approach:
1️⃣ Initialize Counters 📊
Set sa, sb, ta, tb = 0
Track both server states independently
2️⃣ Process Each Time Event ⏰
Read time t and server activity x, y
Check if t == 1 (first event)
3️⃣ Smart State Management 🔄
For Server A: sa += x, ta = 10
For Server B: sb += x, tb = 10
Accumulate activity over time windows
4️⃣ Apply Threshold Logic ✅
If sa >= ta → "LIVE", else → "DEAD"
If sb >= tb → "LIVE", else → "DEAD"

🔑 Key Insight: The solution hinges on maintaining running totals and comparing against threshold values. It simulates real-world server monitoring where we track activity patterns to determine system health! 🏥

⚡ Performance: 
✅ All test cases passed 
🚀 Execution: 62-156 ms 
💾 Memory: 0-32 KB 
🎯 Clean conditional logic

This problem beautifully demonstrates how coding skills translate to real IT infrastructure management! 💼
