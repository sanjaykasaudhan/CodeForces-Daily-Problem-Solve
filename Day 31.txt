🎯 Problem Overview: An elegant combinatorial problem requiring identification of accumulation patterns with mathematical formula derivation.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Direct formula application with conditional adjustment

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Parsing: Read N, M with map(int, input().split()) 
2️⃣ Formula Calculation: ans = N * (M - 1) 
3️⃣ Edge Case Check: If M == 1:
Adjust: ans += N - 1 
4️⃣ Output Result: Print final answer

🧮 Key Mathematical Insights:
Base Formula: N * (M - 1) captures primary pattern
Special Case: When M == 1, add correction term N - 1
Multiplication: Combines dimensions efficiently
Conditional Logic: Single if-statement for edge case
No Iteration: Direct O(1) calculation
Pattern Recognition: Formula derived from combinatorial analysis

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 31ms, 8KB
Test 2: 31ms, 8KB
Test 3: 46ms, 20KB
Consistent O(1) performance! 🚀
