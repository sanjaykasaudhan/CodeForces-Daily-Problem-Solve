🧠 Problem Understanding
In this game:
There are n children standing in a circle
Child 1 starts with the ball
The ball is passed by skipping increasing steps:
First pass → skip 1 child
Second pass → skip 2 children
… and so on
We need to print the order of children who receive the ball, without repetition.

🔍 Approach & Logic
✔️ The problem is solved using modular arithmetic to simulate circular movement.
Step-by-step approach:
Start from position cur = 1
For each step i from 1 to n-1:
Move forward by i positions using (cur + i) % n
If the result becomes 0, treat it as n (since children are numbered from 1 to n)
Store each visited position in a list
Print the final sequence
This approach ensures:
✅ No extra space usage
✅ Efficient simulation of circular traversal
✅ Time complexity O(n)

🧪 Sample Result
For n = 10

 ➡️ Output: 2 4 7 1 6 2 9 7 6
 (All validations passed ✔️)

💡 Key Takeaway:
 Simple math + modulo logic can efficiently solve circular traversal problems. These concepts are very common in competitive programming and interview questions.

🚀 Consistently practicing problems like this sharpens problem-solving and logical thinking.
