🎯 Problem Overview: An elegant combinatorial problem requiring optimal team formation based on group size preferences with frequency constraints.

💡 The Approach:
Core Strategy: Greedy pairing with remainder calculation

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Processing: Read count n and array a 
2️⃣ Frequency Counting:
ones = a.count(1) (groups of size 1)
twos = a.count(2) (groups of size 2) 
3️⃣ Team Initialization: teams = 0 
4️⃣ Greedy Pairing: use = min(twos, ones) (pair 1s with 2s) 
5️⃣ State Update:
teams += use
ones -= use
twos -= use 
6️⃣ Remainder Handling: teams += ones // 3 (group remaining 1s in threes) 
7️⃣ Result Output: Print total teams

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Priority Pairing: Match 1s with 2s first (creates teams of 3)
Min Function: min(twos, ones) ensures no over-pairing
Integer Division: ones // 3 groups remaining individuals
Frequency Approach: Count-based solution instead of sorting
O(n) Count Phase: Linear time for frequency counting
Greedy Optimality: Always pair before grouping ensures maximum teams

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 62ms, 24KB
Test 2: 31ms, 0KB ⚡
Efficient frequency-based solution! 🚀

🎓 Combinatorial Optimization: This problem demonstrates the power of greedy algorithms in resource allocation. By prioritizing optimal pairings, we maximize team formation! 🎯
