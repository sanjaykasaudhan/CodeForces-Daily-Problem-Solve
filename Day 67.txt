🧠 What made this special
Worked directly with qubits instead of classical variables
Used the Hadamard (H) gate to generate superposition
Learned how a simple loop can scale quantum states exponentially
Great hands-on exposure to quantum primitives & canonical gates
This problem beautifully demonstrated how quantum logic differs from classical thinking.

🌱 Learning Takeaway
Exploring quantum problems alongside classical DSA keeps the learning curve exciting.
 Step by step, moving toward future-ready computing paradigms 💡
