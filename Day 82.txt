🧠 Problem Insight
We are given a string and allowed to remove exactly k characters.
 The task is to check whether the remaining characters can be rearranged into a palindrome.

💡 Key Logic Used
Count frequency of each character
Track how many characters have odd frequency
After removing k characters, the remaining string length decides:
Even length → 0 odd frequencies allowed
Odd length → 1 odd frequency allowed
A simple parity check makes the solution efficient and elegant.

✅ What This Reinforced
Strong understanding of palindrome properties
Efficient use of hashing (Counter)
Turning constraints into clean logical conditions
Consistent practice, small wins, steady growth 🚀
