🧠 What this problem taught me
Handling string-based numbers instead of direct floating-point operations
Implementing rounding logic carefully to avoid precision issues
Paying close attention to edge cases (especially when digits hit ‘9’)
Sometimes the smallest problems hide the most interesting corner cases.

🚀 Takeaway
Competitive programming isn’t just about speed — it’s about thinking clearly and coding precisely.

One more problem done, many more to go 💪
