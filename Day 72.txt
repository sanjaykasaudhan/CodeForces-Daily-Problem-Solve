🧠 Key Idea
The problem looks musical 🎶, but it’s really about string processing.
👉 Replace the repeated "WUB" patterns
 👉 Extract only meaningful words
 👉 Join them back with proper spacing
A nice reminder that simple string manipulation + clean logic can solve many problems efficiently.

🚀 Learning
Not every problem needs heavy algorithms —
 sometimes clarity, pattern recognition, and edge-case handling do the job perfectly.
Consistency > Speed.
 Onward to the next problem 💪
