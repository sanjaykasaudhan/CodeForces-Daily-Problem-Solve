🎯 Problem Overview: An elegant mathematical problem requiring calculation of optimal present distribution following a specific pattern.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Direct mathematical formula with parity handling

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Reading: Parse value n 
2️⃣ Even Case Formula: ke = 2 * (n // 3) 
3️⃣ Odd Case Formula: ko = 2 * ((n-1) // 3) + 1 if n % 1 else 0 
4️⃣ Result Selection: print(max(ke, ko))

🧮 Key Mathematical Insights:
Pattern Recognition: Distribution follows 3-cycle pattern
Integer Division: n // 3 determines complete cycles
Parity Check: n % 1 (always False) - likely typo, should be n % 3
Multiplication Factor: 2 * represents paired distribution
Max Selection: Choose optimal between even and odd cases
O(1) Complexity: Constant time calculation!

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 46ms, 4KB ⚡
Test 2: 15ms, 16KB
Test 3: 31ms, 12KB
Ultra-fast with minimal memory! 🚀

🎓 Formula Optimization: This problem demonstrates the power of mathematical insight! Instead of simulation, derive the closed-form formula by recognizing the repeating pattern. 📐
