🧠 Problem Insight
Given a list of colors (numbers), the task is to determine the minimum number of colors required such that:
All existing colors are included
Any missing color starting from 0 is filled sequentially
In simpler terms, we need to find the MEX (Minimum Excluded Number) of the array.

🔍 Solution Approach
The idea is straightforward and efficient:
Convert the list into a set to remove duplicates
Start checking from d = size of the set
While d exists in the set:
Add it to the set
Increment d
The first value of d not found in the set is the answer
This guarantees we find the smallest missing non-negative integer.

⚙️ Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

💡 Key Learning
This problem reinforces how:
Sets enable fast lookups
Knowing common concepts like MEX helps solve problems quickly
Simple logic can lead to elegant solutions ✨

📈 Consistently practicing on Codeforces to strengthen DSA fundamentals and problem-solving skills.
