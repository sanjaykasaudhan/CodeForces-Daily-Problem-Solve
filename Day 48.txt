🧠 Problem Understanding
Given:
A month m
A day d (starting weekday offset)
We need to determine how many weeks are required to display that month on a calendar.

🔍 Solution Approach
The idea is to compute how many days are occupied in the calendar grid:
Store the number of days in each month
Compute total occupied cells as:
total=days[m−1]+(d−1)\text{total} = \text{days}[m-1] + (d - 1)total=days[m−1]+(d−1)
Since a week has 7 days, compute:
weeks=⌈total7⌉\text{weeks} = \left\lceil \frac{\text{total}}{7} \right\rceilweeks=⌈7total​⌉
In code, ceiling division is achieved using:
 (total + 6) // 7

⚙️ Complexity
Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)

💡 Key Takeaway
This problem shows how:
Careful interpretation of the calendar layout matters
Mathematical tricks like ceiling division simplify solutions
Even simple problems reinforce important fundamentals ✨
