🎯 Problem Overview: A practical division problem requiring calculation of resources needed with ceiling division logic and multiplication.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Ceiling division using math.ceil for resource allocation

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Parsing: Read k, n, s, p with map(int, input().split()) 
2️⃣ Math Import: Use import math for ceiling function 
3️⃣ Per-Person Calculation: sheets_per_person = math.ceil(n / s) 
4️⃣ Total Sheets: total_sheets = sheets_per_person * k 
5️⃣ Final Division: print(math.ceil(total_sheets / p))

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Ceiling Function: math.ceil() rounds up to ensure sufficient resources
Two-Stage Calculation: First per-person, then per-packet
Resource Allocation: Always round up to avoid shortages
Multiplication: Scale individual needs by group size
Nested Division: Handle both distributions with ceiling
O(1) Complexity: Direct mathematical computation
