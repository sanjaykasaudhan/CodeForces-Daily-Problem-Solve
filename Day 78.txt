🧠 Problem Insight
The task is to maximize profit by selecting at most m items with negative prices (losses), so that selling them gives maximum gain.

💡 Approach
Filter only negative prices
Sort them in ascending order (most negative first)
Pick up to m values
Output the absolute sum of selected values
This greedy strategy ensures we always choose the items that give the maximum benefit.

✅ Key Learnings
Greedy + sorting solves many optimization problems
Always reduce the problem to what actually matters
Simple logic beats overcomplicated simulations
Another problem done, consistency continues 🚀
