🧠 Problem Summary
We are given a list of strings and an initially empty string s.
 For each string:
We can add it either to the left or to the right of s
Our goal is to build the lexicographically smallest possible string

🔍 Approach & Logic
This problem is solved using a greedy comparison strategy:
Step-by-step:
Start with an empty string s
Iterate through each string x:
If s is empty → assign s = x
Otherwise:
Compare two possibilities:
x + s (adding to the front)
s + x (adding to the end)
Choose the lexicographically smaller of the two
This works because:
At every step, we make the locally optimal choice
Lexicographical comparison ensures the global minimum result
No backtracking is required

⚙️ Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n · k), where k is average string length
Space Complexity: O(k) for the resulting string

💡 Key Learning
This problem is a great example of how:
Greedy decisions + string comparison can lead to optimal solutions
Thinking about both directions (left & right insertion) is crucial
Clean logic often beats complex data structures ✨

📈 Staying consistent with Codeforces is helping me strengthen my problem-solving mindset and algorithmic thinking.
