🎯 Problem Overview: A clever shopping simulation problem requiring optimal matching strategy between customer money and game prices.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Two-pointer greedy matching with sequential processing

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Parsing: Read n, m and arrays c (customer money), a (game prices) 
2️⃣ Pointer Initialization: Set i = j = 0 for dual traversal, ans = 0 for count 
3️⃣ While Loop: Continue while i < n and j < m 
4️⃣ Matching Logic: If a[j] <= c[i]:
Increment ans += 1 (successful purchase)
Move both pointers: j += 1, i += 1 
5️⃣ Skip Logic: Else, increment i += 1 (insufficient money) 
6️⃣ Result Output: Print total games purchased

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Two-Pointer Technique: Simultaneous traversal of both arrays
Greedy Selection: Match first affordable game in sequence
Sequential Processing: Maintain order of customers and games
Conditional Advancement: Smart pointer movement based on affordability
Early Termination: Loop ends when either array exhausted
O(n + m) Complexity: Linear time with single pass

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 62ms, 0KB ⚡
Test 2: 46ms, 0KB
Blazing fast with zero memory overhead! 🚀

🎓 Algorithm Pattern Recognition: This problem beautifully demonstrates the two-pointer pattern for matching/pairing problems. The greedy approach ensures optimal matching in sequential scenarios! 🎯
