📊 Local Extrema - Array Pattern Detection! 📊

Just solved "Local Extrema" from Educational Codeforces Round 32 - Accepted! ✅

🔗Problem Link: https://lnkd.in/gNhjnxsP

🎯 Problem Overview: An elegant array analysis problem requiring detection of local maximum and minimum points based on neighbor comparisons.

💡 The Approach: 
🔍 Core Strategy: Sequential neighbor comparison with counter accumulation

📝 Solution Breakdown: 
1️⃣ Input Parsing: Read length n and array a 
2️⃣ Counter Initialization: Set c = 0 for extrema count 
3️⃣ Boundary Loop: Iterate for i in range(1, n-1) (excluding edges) 
4️⃣ Local Maximum Check:
if (a[i] > a[i-1] and a[i] > a[i+1]): increment counter 
5️⃣ Local Minimum Check:
or (a[i] < a[i-1] and a[i] < a[i+1]): increment counter 
6️⃣ Result Output: Print total extrema count

🧮 Key Algorithmic Insights:
Three-Element Window: Compare element with both neighbors
Boundary Exclusion: range(1, n-1) avoids edge cases
Dual Condition: OR operator captures both maxima and minima
Strict Comparison: Use > and < for local extrema (not plateaus)
Single Pass: O(n) linear scan through array
Boolean Logic: Combined conditions with and and or

⚡ Performance Metrics:
Test 1: 62ms, 0KB ⚡
Test 2: 46ms, 12KB
Test 3: 0ms, 0KB (Perfect!)
Ultra-efficient pattern detection! 🚀

🎓 Array Analysis Mastery: This problem showcases classic peak/valley detection in sequences. The key insight: a point is an extremum if it's strictly greater OR strictly less than both neighbors! 📈📉
