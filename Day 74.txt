💡 Key Insight
A number has an odd divisor greater than 1 if and only if
 ➡️ it is not a power of 2.
So the approach is simple:
Keep dividing n by 2
If something greater than 1 remains → YES
Otherwise → NO
Elegant logic, zero overthinking.

📌 What this reinforces
Mathematical observations can drastically simplify problems
Clean loops > complex checks
Competitive programming trains clarity of thought
Onward with consistent practice 🚀
